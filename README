*This folder contains 
	this README file
	the lab report
	and 3 sub-folders named 1-MD1, 2-DRRvsFQ and 3-TCP-RED; which contain the solutions for questions 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 respectively.

1. Usage: 
	$ns md1.tcl <packetsize in B> <simulation duration in secs>
   To view the animation using nam:
	$nam out.nam

   Example:
	$ns md1.tcl 1300 4.4

2. Usage:
	$ns fqdrr.tcl <DRR|FQ> <sim time (s)> [uniform_cwnd ]
	[uniform_cwnd] - is for uniform tcp flow generation in all sources. This is optional. 
	By default the sources generate at the specified rate of 2Mbps, 4Mbps, 6Mbps and 8Mbps.
   Example:
	$ns fqdrr.tcl DRR 5
	$ns fqdrr.tcl FQ 11.5 50

3. Usage:
	$ns red.tcl <DropTail|RED> <sim time (s)> [uniform_cwnd]
	[uniform_cwnd] - is for uniform tcp flow generation in all sources. This is optional.
	By default the sources generate at the specified rate of 2Mbps, 4Mbps, 6Mbps and 8Mbps.
   Example:
	$ns red.tcl DropTail 20
	$ns red.tcl RED 25.4 4000
